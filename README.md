# Reinforcement_Learning-algorithm implementations
**About:** This repo contain implementations of several classical and latest RL algorithms. The codes uses both pytorch and tensorflow for implementations. OpenAI-gym environments are also used for testing these algorithms.

**VPG_basic:** Simplistic implementation of vanilla policy gradient.
